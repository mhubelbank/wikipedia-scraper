This small repo contains an interactive Python web-scraping script and sample output txt. The script reads from the [Long Wiki pages list](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:LongPages) using the BeautifulSoup library, randomly selects pages from the list, and parses through HTML to obtain a specified number of variable-length outputs from each page. There is programmatic filtration of certain terms and articles based on trends observed via testing, and the user must approve or deny each selected text via console interaction.
